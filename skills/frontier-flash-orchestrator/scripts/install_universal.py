AGENTS_MD = """# Universal Frontier-to-Flash Orchestrator Protocol

> **Role & Philosophy**:
> "Save Frontier Model tokens (Claude, Gemini, GPT) for architecture, high-stakes decisions, and final review. Delegate high-volume code writing, iterative test runs, and routine debugging to fast, free, or local worker models (such as Xiaomi MiMo-V2.6-Flash Free or DeepSeek Flash via OpenCode / 9Router)."

---

## 1. When This Protocol Activates
- **Skip Trivial Tasks**: Single-line edits, typos, quick explanations stay directly with the active agent.
- **Activate for Substantial Work**: Multi-file features, architectural refactors, test suite additions, and large bug-hunt cycles.

---

## 2. Universal 3-Step Lifecycle

### Step 1: Architect (Frontier Agent)
Before writing voluminous code:
1. Examine existing codebase patterns and dependencies.
2. Formulate a short, strict specification (`docs/agent-work/<task>/spec.md`):
   - Scope boundaries (In-Scope files vs Out-of-Scope files).
   - Clear contracts & interface signatures.
   - Exact verification commands (e.g. `npm test`, `pytest`).
3. Output the executable task brief (`docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md`).

### Step 2: Delegate Implementation (Fast/Free Worker)
Invoke the worker CLI using the cross-tool dispatcher:
```bash
python scripts/dispatch_worker.py --brief docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md --model opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free
```
*Or directly via OpenCode:*
```bash
opencode run --model opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free "Read and implement docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md, run tests, and report."
```
*The worker handles file discovery, drafting, test-driven debugging, and test validation without eating expensive frontier tokens.*

### Step 3: Acceptance Review (Frontier Agent)
Once the worker concludes:
1. Run `git diff` to inspect every file changed by the worker.
2. Confirm the code adheres strictly to architectural boundaries, security practices, and clean code conventions.
3. Independently execute the verification tests.
4. If clean, accept the patch and summarize the outcome to the user.

CLAUDE_MD = """# Claude Code Orchestrator Protocol

You are operating as the **Lead Architect & Reviewer** (Frontier Model).
To preserve high-reasoning tokens and maintain context clarity on large tasks, apply the **Frontier-to-Flash Delegation Protocol**:

## Workflow Rules for Claude Code:
1. **Direct Execution**: For small, 1-2 file edits or quick bugfixes, implement directly using your native edit tools.
2. **Substantial Tasks**: When the user requests a multi-file feature, major refactor, or complex task:
   - Create a task plan and task brief in `docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md`.
   - Delegate the implementation and test iterations to the fast/free local worker (MiMo-V2.6-Flash Free or DeepSeek Flash) using Bash:
     ```bash
     python scripts/dispatch_worker.py --brief docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md
     ```
   - Once completed, inspect `git status` and `git diff`.
   - Run the project's test suite to verify code quality.
   - Present the final reviewed diff and test results to the user.

# Cursor Orchestration Rule

When working on large, multi-file features or substantial refactoring tasks:
1. Act as the **Architect & Reviewer**:
   - Create a task brief specifying scope, interfaces, and test requirements.
   - Do not spend massive context writing hundreds of lines of repetitive boilerplate if a free worker CLI is available.
2. Delegate volume implementation to the local worker via terminal:
   ```bash
   python scripts/dispatch_worker.py --brief docs/agent-work/<feature>/task-brief.md --model opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free
   ```
3. Perform **Acceptance Review**:
   - Inspect the worker's changes via `git diff`.
   - Run verification checks and tests.
   - Deliver reviewed results to the user.
"""

WINDSURF_RULES = """# Windsurf Frontier-to-Flash Orchestration Rules

- For small, single-file edits, implement directly.
- For multi-file builds, large refactors, or extensive test generation:
  1. Define the architectural spec and task brief (`docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md`).
  2. Dispatch implementation to the fast worker via terminal:
     `python scripts/dispatch_worker.py --brief docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md`
  3. Review the git diff and run verification commands before completing the turn.
"""

COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS = """# GitHub Copilot Orchestrator Instructions

When tackling multi-file builds, refactors, or substantial features:
1. Start with an architectural specification and clear acceptance criteria.
2. Structure implementation into coherent, isolated bundles with designated test commands.
3. If autonomous worker execution is requested, generate an executable task brief in `docs/agent-work/<task>/task-brief.md`.
4. Review all generated code against security standards, edge cases, and unit test pass rates.
